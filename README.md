![Stopped](/resources/doc-images/icons/icon_stopped.png) | ![Stopped](/resources/doc-images/icons/icon_overlay_stopped.png) | AEM instances is currently starting or stopped, Felix console is not available, unable to get bundle status

![Running](/resources/doc-images/icons/icon_running.png) | ![Running](/resources/doc-images/icons/icon_overlay_running.png) | AEM instances is running and all bundles are started


Preferences
-----------

From the AEM Manager window you can configure preferences via File > Preferences. Currenty the log viewer application can be configured that is used by the shortcuts to log files of an AEM instance.

It is recommended to install [Otros Log Viewer](https://github.com/otros-systems/otroslogviewer) and configure it in the preference dialog.

Here you will find a customized Log-importer configuration so Otros Log Viewer will understand the default AEM log file format by default: [otros-config](https://github.com/wcm-io/wcm-io-tooling/tree/develop/misc/log-analysis/otros-config).


Trouble Shooting
-----------

If AEM Manager is running and the window disappears - try this:

1. Move the mouse cursor over the icon in the taskbar and click the right mouse button. The following pop-up should appear:
